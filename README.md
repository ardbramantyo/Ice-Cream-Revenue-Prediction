# Ice Cream Revenue Prediction
As an owner of an ice cream business, I want to create a model that could predict the daily revenue based on the outside temperature. I decide that a linear regression model might be a good candidate to solve the problem.

The dataset itself, consist of 500+ data sample and 2 fields:
 - Independent var (X): outside air temperature (deg C)
 - Dependent var (Y): Overall daily revenue ($)
